# SPI-Slave-Interface-with-RAM
Designed an SPI slave controller with integrated async RAM, handling serial data conversion and read/write commands via a finite state machine. Implemented address/data buffering and validated functionality with self-checking testbenches. Achieved reliable communication between master-slave devices under timing constraints.
